# ZSH

These are my configuration files for ZSH.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although ZSH recommends you update `$PATH` in `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv`, this should
> not be done on MacOS.
>
> Instead, modify `$PATH` in `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc` or `$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile`.
>
> See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Linerre/f11ad4a6a934dcf01ee8415c9457e7b2)
> for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> Both `zshrc.old` and `ruby.sh` are both from my old zsh config. They will be removed
> in the future. I'm just keeping them here in case I need to use anything from
> them in the future.
