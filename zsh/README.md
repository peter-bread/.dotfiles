# ZSH

These are configuration files for ZSH.

> [!WARNING]
> Although ZSH recommends you update `$PATH` in `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv`, this should
> not be done on MacOS.
>
> Instead, modify `$PATH` in `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc` or `$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile`.
>
> See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Linerre/f11ad4a6a934dcf01ee8415c9457e7b2)
> for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> I am currently rewriting my ZSH config. `zshrc.new` is going to replace `zshrc`
> at some point.

> [!WARNING]
> In `.zshrc`, there are references to `$HOME/.zshrc.d`.
> This file is currently on my local machine and not version controlled.
