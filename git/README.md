# Git

## `gitconfig`

This is the main config file for all git settings.

## `gitignore`

This is a global ignore file. The purpose of this is to make it very difficult to
accidentally commit files that should **never** be included in version control.

## `gitconfig-*`

These are account specific settings, i.e. email and SSH command.

`peter-bread` is my main account and is scoped to my home directory,
and `ak22112` only works in `~/Developer/ak22112`.
